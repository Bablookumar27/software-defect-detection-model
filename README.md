# Software Defect Detection Model

This repository, [Bablookumar27/software-defect-detection-model](https://github.com/Bablookumar27/software-defect-detection-model), is focused on implementing software defect detection using Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

The project aims to provide a model to detect defects in software code using data-driven and potentially machine learning approaches. The codebase is implemented entirely in Jupyter Notebook format, making it ideal for experimentation, analysis, and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure

- The repository is composed 100% of Jupyter Notebook files.
- Main files are likely to include:
  - Data preprocessing and exploration notebooks
  - Model training and evaluation notebooks
  - Results analysis and visualization notebooks

## Purpose

The primary goal is to build and evaluate models for automated defect detection in software, which can help improve code quality and reliability.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bablookumar27/software-defect-detection-model.git
   ```
2. **Open the notebooks:**
   - Use [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/) to run and interact with the `.ipynb` files.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook (Python environment)
- Additional dependencies will be listed in each notebook's first cell or in a requirements file (if provided).

## Usage

- Open the main notebook(s) and follow the instructions to explore data, train models, and evaluate defect detection results.
